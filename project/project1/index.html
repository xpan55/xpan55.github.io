<p>What is translation ambiguity? We say that translation ambiguity occurs when a word in one language has more than one translation in another language, and this is often due to semantic ambiguity in one of the languages. For example, the English ambiguous word bark is translated into two distinct words in French, “aboiement” for dog bark and “ecorce” for tree bark. This mapping from one English word to two words in other languages is called translation ambiguity.</p>
<p>In a bilingual’s daily life, the two unrelated words (aboiement and ecorce) could be activated together because the shared association with the same English word bark. As a result of this concurrent activation, the association between aboiement and ecorce could be strengthened although they are unrelated in French.</p>
<p><img src="/image/project1_image1.png" alt=" "></p>
<p>Major question to answer in the current study: <strong>when a bilingual reads the word for “tree bark” in his/her first language (L1), does the “dog bark” meaning become activated?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>We selected 40 semantic ambiguous words in English that translate into different words in French and Chinese, For each ambiguous word, a spelling control was picked matching on word frequency and word length with the translation 2 (e.g., cerise abd ecorce).</p>
<p><img src="/image/project1_2.png" alt=" "></p>
<p>Two sentences were created for each ambiguous word based on meaning 1, in English and then translated them into French and Chinese.</p>
<p>For example, two sentences for the word <em><strong>bark</strong></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The dog let out a loud <strong>bark</strong> when he saw a squirrel.</em></li>
<li><em>He found his dog when he heard a <strong>bark</strong> coming from behind the shed.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Then we substitute the ambiguous word in the sentence with either the ambiguous partner or the spelling control.</p>
<p>We also collected ratings on how probable these two types of error words are as continuations in the sentence context, and how predictable the correct words are in the sentence context.
The ratings confirmed that the ambiguity substitutions and spelling controls are equally wrong in the sentence context. And the correct words are equally predictable in the sentence context.</p>
<p>Data were collected on 57 French-English bilinguals and 41 Chinese-English bilinguals- they did an online moving window self-paced reading task- they control their own pace of reading by pressing the spacebar and rts were collected on how long it takes for them to read each word in the sentence.</p>
<p>We analysed response times for the critical word, one word before, one word after, and two words after the critical word.
In the French study, we found a difference between ambiguity substitutions and spelling controls in reading times on one word after the critical word (p = .02) and two words after the critical word (p = .08). Spelling controls words were read slower than the ambiguity substitutions.
And results of the Chinese study showed a similar pattern. We found a difference between ambiguity substitutions and spelling controls on the critical word (p = .02) and two words after the critical word (p = .02).
These results provide evidence that Mapping of two L1 words onto one L2 word strengthens the associations between the two otherwise unrelated L1 words.</p>
