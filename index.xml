      <description>Online Self-Paced Reading
Participants read the sentences in an online moving window SPR task in which they control their own pace of reading by pressing the spacebar. Data were collected on how long (in ms) it takes to read each word in the sentence.
Click HERE for a demo of the online SPR task in English.
(The experiment was created with PsychoPy and hosted on Pavlovia.)</description>
