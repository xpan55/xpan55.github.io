      <description>As a research scientist with 8+ years of experience in language-cognition interaction and bilingualism, I am experienced with examing human behaviours through carefully designed experiments.
As a data analyst with 8+ years of experience with SPSS, R, and SQL, I am passionate about making sense of complex data and telling stories that helps people derive insight.
As a newbie birder, WOW and OMG, why didn&amp;rsquo;t I notice there are so many lovely birds around me?</description>
